    <h1>Mahmoud Haggag</h1>
    I'm 28 Years old.
    I lived all my life imagining myself working in oil and gas field, I was happy at the begining and so exited but I didn't know that it's a nightmare.. draging you away from your life, family and friends. I decided to change career into something related to the software, I started as Web developer and I like it ! Wish me good luck :D
